Notes on the cda0 project
=========================

10/3/22:
* Spent approx 3 hr setting up & beginning the coding.

10/4/22:
* Time spent:  
  17:00 - 18:44 = 1:44
  21:21 - 
* Decided to go forward with the somewhat awkward and non-extensible approach of modeling observations to include states on
  exactly 3 neighbor vehicles.  For a future version I will replace that with a more general approach that looks at the
  roadway itself (analogous to an Atari agent viewing screen pixels rather than tracking a number of alien ships).
